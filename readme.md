# Make your app material XYZReader project

Updating look and feel of an app to meet material design specifications.


## Why this Project
Implement changes that will improve the UI and make it conform to Material Design.

## What Did I Learn?
I spent most of the time on implementing activity transition animations. Became more comfortable with CoordinatorLayout. I choose this assignment to complete first because I was a overwhelmed by design part of the app development. After completing this project I feel more comfortable in dealing with design and where to look for answers when it comes to designing an android app.
